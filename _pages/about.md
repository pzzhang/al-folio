I'm an AI research scientist at FAIR Computer Vision team of AI@Meta and an affiliate assistant professor in the department of Electrical Engineering, University of Washington. I was a principal researcher at Microsoft Research, Redmond. Before joining Microsoft, I obtained my PhD degree in Applied and Computational Mathematics from Caltech in 2017. My research interests are mainly in the areas of deep learning, computer vision, multimodal intelligence, and theoretical foundations for deep learning.
