Iâ€™m starting a new position as Research Scientist at Meta AI for VR. I will continue my long-term pursuit of CV and Multi-modal intelligence at my new position. Looking forward to work with colleagues and the entire community, to build intelligent and trust-able technologies for the metaverse, and to push the research frontier of deep learning, CV and multi-modal.
