We have five papers accepted at NeurIPS2022, all of which are about #computervision and vision-language intelligence. Huge thanks and congratulations to all collaborators!
1. GLIPv2: Unifying Localization and VL Understanding https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05836
2. Coarse-to-Fine Vision-Language Pre-training with Fusion in the Backbone https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07643
3. K-LITE: Learning Transferable Visual Models with External Knowledge
https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09222
4. 3DB: A Framework for Debugging Computer Vision Models
https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.03805
5. ELEVATER: A Benchmark and Toolkit for Evaluating Language-Augmented Visual Models
https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.08790

We are also organizing an ECCV2022 workshop https://computer-vision-in-the-wild.github.io/eccv-2022/
Last call for papers and challenge participation in solving problems on open-set recognition and task-level visual transfer.
